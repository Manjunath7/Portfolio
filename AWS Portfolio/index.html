    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently enrolled in the postgraduate certificate program in Cloud Computing Technologies at George Brown College, Toronto, where I am actively expanding my technical expertise in cloud infrastructure, virtualization, infrastructure as code (IaC), and DevOps methodologies. Through hands-on lab work and real-world projects, I’ve gained experience with AWS and Microsoft Azure, deploying and managing cloud resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Azure Storage Accounts, Load Balancers, Virtual Networks, and configuring role-based access control (RBAC) and monitoring tools like CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this, I accumulated over 2.5 years of professional experience as a Reconciliation Developer in the financial services industry, where I played a pivotal role in ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of high-volume transactional data. I developed and managed automated reconciliation workflows using AutoSys for job scheduling and monitoring, Oracle SQL for advanced query writing and data validation, and shell scripting to streamline system operations across Unix/Linux environments. My responsibilities included troubleshooting production issues, implementing data quality controls, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to support time-sensitive financial reporting processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This combination of hands-on cloud education and real-world automation experience gives me a unique perspective on designing resilient, secure, and scalable systems that align with business needs. I’m particularly driven by opportunities that allow me to bridge the gap between traditional IT operations and modern cloud-native solutions.
